Stretch Questions

    Relativly position it 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    block: div , h1-6 <p>
    inline:span a 
    inline/block button

    The box model is a box that wraps all HTML. It contains content, padding, borders and margin.
    The issue is that it gives many design erros such as overlapping or other issues. 
    The fix is 
    "box-sizing: border-box". 
    apply a natural box layout model to all elements */
*, *:before, *:after {
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;
}
